Due to the limitation of Git LFS storage space, we put the GPT2 models and 10,000 pieces of coverage testcases in Google Drive.

You can download the GPT2 models [here](), including the 117M pre-training model and the NISL_MODEL model, and put them in the directory: `.\src\generate_model\models`

You can download coverage test cases [here](), including 10,000 pieces of generated testcases for each Fuzzer, and put them in the directory: `.\data\coverage_files`
