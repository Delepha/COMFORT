# Automated Conformance Testing for JavaScript Engines via Deep Compiler Fuzzing: Artifact

This directory contains the supporting artifact for our paper on PLDI 2021 paper on Javascript Conformance Testing. It contains reduced-size data sets for evaluating our testcase generator, testcase harness, and differential tester. The idea is that this directory contains minimal working examples which can be evaluated in a reasonable amount of time. All of our code and data will be open-sourced upon publication and has been developed with extensibility as a primary goal.
